# LibWorkInstructions

This repository and associated issue tracker are to contain artifacts from the Acutec+Allegheny group internship project
focused around implementing a C#/dotnetcore library handling the data modeling and business logic of Work Instructions.
Work Instructions is the system by which operators on the shop floor are relayed operational details managed primarily
by the engineering team.  Refer to the issue tracker for more in-depth coverage of the requirements gathering process.

# Using the Library
This portion of the README is dedicated to describing each method and how it should be used.  They are categorized into what kind of object they relate to.  For example, all methods referring to `WorkInstructions` will be written under the `WorkInstructions` section, and so on for each section.
